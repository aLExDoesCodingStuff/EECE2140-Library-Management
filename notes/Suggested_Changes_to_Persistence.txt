- Separate all the loading/saving functionality into a separate SaveManager class


- Expand catalog_system() to track:

	- the waitlist for a book (ie, for a certain book, who is in the waitlist and what is their current position)

	- pending holds (where a user has been through the whole waitlist already, but still needs to check out the book). Should track the user, and the days remaining until their hold expires. 

- Make a new method that actually recreates the previous state of the library using the dataframe returned by load_state(),(basically doing the reverse of catalog_system()). 
	- For example, for all the users with checked-out books, it should call checkout_item(). Everyone in the waitlist for a book should get placed back into the waitlist, etc.
