Library Management V1

===================================================
## IN PROGRESS
===================================================
Persistence
	Current state:
		- catalog_system() takes a list of users, retrieves info about the books they have checked out, and compiles it into a master_list_catalog
		- save_state() converts the catalog created by catalog_system() into a Pandas dataframe, then into a CSV savefile
		- load_state() checks for an existing savefile at the start of a session, and parses it back into a Pandas dataframe, or else returns an empty dataframe
	Changes to make:
		- Expand catalog_system() to track the waitlist for a book (ie, for a certain book, who is in the waitlist and what is their current position)
		- Expand catalog_system() to track pending holds (where a user has been through the whole waitlist already, but still needs to check out the book). Should track the user, and the days remaining until their hold expires. 
		- Make a new method which, using the dataframe returned by load_state(), actually recreates the previous state of the library (basically doing the reverse of catalog_system()). For example, for all the users with checked-out books, it should call checkout_item(). Everyone in the waitlist for a book should get placed back into the waitlist, etc. 
				

===================================================
## IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING
===================================================
LIBRARY CLASS
	Instance Variables
		- inventory (list[Book])
	Functions
		- listInv()
		- checkout_item()
		- return_item()
		- parseCSV() - populates inventory from a CSV using Pandas
	Notes:
		- TO ADD:
			- search function!!
				- search by title, author, ISBN(not yet added to Book)
			- access control system
				- list of registered 'User' accounts authorized to make requests (checkout,return,etc)
				- list of registered 'Admin' accounts authorized to access/manipulate database
			- persistence
				- library database should be constantly backed up to disk storage
				- eventually transition to a distributed application with always-on library server
		
				
			
BOOK CLASS
	Instance Variables
		- title
		- author
		- copies (list[dict])
		- waitlist (deque)
	Functions
		-make_copies() - creates a certain number of book copy dictionaries
		-locate_copies() - prints the borrower/borrow_date for the list of copies

		
USER CLASS
	Instance Variables
		- username (str)
		- items_checked_out (list[Book])
		- hold_items (list[Book])
	Functions
		- print_hold_items() - print list of Books on hold (Book(s) for which user(self) is in waitlist)
		- print_checked_out() - print list of Books currently checked out by user
	Notes:
		- TO ADD:
			- username/password: access authentification via the Library system
		
	
	
===================================================
## NOT IMPLEMENTED
===================================================

- waitlist/hold functionality:
	- once a user returns a book, check the waitlist status for that book
		- if empty...
			-  do nothing
		- if not empty...
			- notify 1st user in line that the book is available
			- start a 3-day hold timer for them to check out the book
				- (if not checked out w/in 3-days, 1st user is removed from waitlist, and process repeats)
